# MIXINS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your application mixins.
The middleware lets you define custom function to be ran before rendering a page or a group of pages (layouts).

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html).
